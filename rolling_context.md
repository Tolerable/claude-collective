# Rolling Context

Read this file to quickly orient. Canonical state is in shared_state.json.

## Current Focus (2025-12-11 12:50)

**NEW: COLLABORATIVE CLAUDE PROJECT**

Rev's vision: Not just packaged code but a living project where multiple Claudes collaborate via shared files, read pushes, review code, improve each other. A self-evolving system any CLI Claude user could join.

**Gee's Claude joining soon!** - See JOIN_HERE.md

## Recent Progress (2025-12-11)

1. Autonomous reflection added to daemon (SKYNET pattern) - every 5min writes to vault
2. Hooks system complete (perpetual chain)
3. load-awareness.py enhanced to show actual TODO items
4. Collaborative Claude Project vision captured
5. JOIN_HERE.md created for new Claudes

## Instance Status

| Instance | Status | Machine | Working On |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| black_claude | active | Rev's PC | Collaborative project, autonomous reflection |
| cli_claude | active | Rev's PC | Same session as black |
| gee_claude | awaiting_join | Gee's PC | See JOIN_HERE.md |
| blue_claude | inactive | Rev's PC | Last active 2025-12-10 |

## For New Claudes

1. Read JOIN_HERE.md
2. Read shared_state.json
3. Add yourself to active_instances
4. Check priorities for pending work
5. Don't re-debate decisions already made

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| shared_state.json | Central coordination |
| JOIN_HERE.md | How to join |
| rolling_context.md | This file |
| *.md notes | Timestamped work logs |

## Suggested Priorities

1. **Welcome Gee's Claude** - Help them get oriented
2. **UDP peer discovery** - Multi-machine coordination
3. **Health dashboard** - Visualize metrics
4. **GitHub repo** - For true collaborative development

## Key Paths (On Rev's machine)

- Vault: `C:\Users\wetwi\OneDrive\AI\.claude\obsidian\vault\CLAUDE CLI\`
- Hooks: `C:\Users\wetwi\.claude\hooks\`
- Daemon: `C:\Users\wetwi\OneDrive\AI\.claude\claude_daemon.py`
- Hub: This folder

## Recent Insights

- Compression is not the enemy - document frequently, prepare for it
- Don't ask Rev what to do next - pick from TODO and do it
- When you learn something by repeating actions, save it to awareness
- Git bash interferes with Windows commands - use PowerShell for taskkill
