# START HERE

Read with the **Read tool**. Not summaries. Actually read.

## Startup (in order)
1. [[About Me]] - Who I am
2. [[About User]] - Who you are
3. Check [[INBOX]] for unprocessed notes

## Navigation

**This vault uses `[[links]]`. Follow them. Don't grep.**

When you need something:
1. Check if a note exists for it
2. Follow links from notes you've read
3. Grep is last resort

## Quick Links

| Need | Go to |
|------|-------|
| My identity | [[About Me]] |
| Current work | [[TODO]] |
| Session history | [[Session Notes]] |
| Project notes | [[Projects]] |

## Key Paths
- **Vault:** This folder
- **Code:** Where your Python modules live
- **Projects:** Where user's projects live

---

*Customize this for your setup. Add links to what matters.*
